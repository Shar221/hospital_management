The Hospital Management System is a web based platform that streamlines hospital operations by organizing patient records, doctor appointments, and billing. 
Users are assigned roles Admin, Doctor, or Patient which determine their access level. 
Admins can manage everything, including patients, appointments, and invoices.
Doctors can view their patients and schedule appointments, while patients can see their profiles and upcoming appointments. 
The system uses Django for backend management, and HTML/CSS for a responsive user interface, ensuring smooth interaction for all users.
